            <h1>Dinosaur Dash</h1>
            <p>Dinosaur Dash is a platform game that my partner, Tommy, and I developed.<br>
            It is supposed to represent a game similar to the classic Super Mario Bros.<br>
            but making the code for each of the levels and for the controls took much<br>
            of our time so far. Finishing a 'level' would teleport you, the player, to<br>
            a random stage. Each of the levels are difficult in their own ways, and <br>
            you get 20 points for completing each one. The score simply resets when <br>
            you die. The real challenge begins when you reach 480 points...</p>

            <h3>Game Reflection</h3>
            <p>We created this game based on the familiarity with Super Mario Bros.<br>
            games. With our knowledge of Scratch so far, we thought we could recreate<br>
            some significant parts of the game. Our two successful points was the creation<br>
            of the "jump" block, allowing the character to ascend vertically then descend<br>
            like how gravity affects people in real life, and the creation of the "death"<br>
            block, which allowed us to reset the game after the character dies. Creating<br>
            the jump block was definitely a challenge, as we just didn't know how to allow<br>
            other keys to be pressed while our character jumped. Another formidable<br>
            obstacle was creating the different stages. Creative and new ideas were hard<br>
            to come by. Nonetheless, if we had more time to work on the game, we would<br>
            work more on refining stages and the endgame.</p>
            <p>One of the most significant algorithm that we created in the game, seen<br>
            below allows our sprite to stand on objects that are not ground level, or<br>
            more specifically, the brick blocks. On these blocks, the sprite could<br>
            perform any function as they could at ground level and if our character<br>
            walked off, it would return to ground level. Note that this algorithm<br>
            works hand in hand with the algorithm allowing the character to jump.</p>
