            <h1 id=DD>Dinosaur Dash</h1>
            <p>Dinosaur Dash is a platform game that my partner, Tommy, and I developed.<br>
            It is supposed to represent a game similar to the classic Super Mario Bros.<br>
            but making the code for each of the levels and for the controls took much<br>
            of our time so far. Finishing a 'level' would teleport you, the player, to<br>
            a random stage. Each of the levels are difficult in their own ways, and <br>
            you get 20 points for completing each one. The score simply resets when <br>
            you die. The real challenge begins when you reach 480 points...</p>

            <h3>Game Reflection</h3>
            <p>We created this game based on the familiarity with Super Mario Bros.<br>
            games. With our knowledge of Scratch so far, we thought we could recreate<br>
            some significant parts of the game. Our two successful points was the creation<br>
            of the "jump" block, allowing the character to ascend vertically then descend<br>
            like how gravity affects people in real life, and the creation of the "death"<br>
            block, which allowed us to reset the game after the character dies. Creating<br>
            the jump block was definitely a challenge, as we just didn't know how to allow<br>
            other keys to be pressed while our character jumped. Another formidable<br>
            obstacle was creating the different stages. Creative and new ideas were hard<br>
            to come by. Nonetheless, if we had more time to work on the game, we would<br>
            work more on refining stages and the endgame.</p>
            <p>One of the most significant algorithm that we created in the game, seen<br>
            below allows our sprite to stand on objects that are not ground level, or<br>
            more specifically, the brick blocks. On these blocks, the sprite could<br>
            perform any function as they could at ground level and if our character<br>
            walked off, it would return to ground level. Note that this algorithm<br>
            works hand in hand with the algorithm allowing the character to jump.</p>

            <p>Below are some blocks that we created.</p>

            <h1 id=CYOA>Choose Your Own Adventure Program: Benpigmin</h1>
            <p>In this story, a portly pig, Ben, has been called upon to embark on an <br>
            adventure no other pig would ever think of doing. Through a series of <br>
            life-endangering choices, Ben arrives at Princess Kent's castle to save her<br>
            from a peacock.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>The way we dealt with creating each story event in our program was <br>
            iterative, or following the same patterns. We set the typing speed<br>
            of the text to the same speed, added several pauses for the reader to catch up<br>
            on reading, and a variable for our text (separate from the event variable)<br>
            for cleaner code. Our incremental development processes, however, was<br>
            that with every new path, we had to organize the separate event codes<br>
            so that it would be easier to follow. This would prove to be the most<br>
            difficult part in developing the story, but with two people working at<br>
            once, each of us could prioritize on separate paths at a time. Because<br>
            of how complicated and messy the coding for the scenes would be, we used<br>
            a form of procedural abstraction by dividing our story into sections when<br>
            there is a change between user input and story using variables. In addition<br>
            to that, we further divided our story events by creating a variable for<br>
            the actual story text, then inserting it into the main story event that<br>
            also includes the typing speed and pauses. This is a type of procedural<br>
            abstraction because it allows people who read the code to understand what<br>
            is happening quicker without actually having to read everything. Creating<br>
            this story reminded me of how much I liked the storylines in Mario games,<br>
            where unlike what we created, had a fixed story, but was similar in that<br>
            they were interactive, which enlivens the story experience.</p>
